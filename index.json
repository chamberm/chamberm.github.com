Increasingly, studies are adopting multi-shell dMRI acquisitions to improve the robustness of dMRI-based inferences. However, the impact of b-value choice on the estimation of dMRI measures such as apparent fibre density (AFD) derived from spherical deconvolution is not known. Here, we investigate the impact of b-value sampling scheme on estimates of AFD. First, we performed simulations to assess the correspondence between AFD and simulated intra-axonal signal fraction across multiple b-value sampling schemes. We then studied the impact of sampling scheme on the relationship between AFD and age in a developmental population (n = 78) aged 8-18 (mean = 12.4, SD = 2.9 years) using hierarchical clustering and whole brain fixel-based analyses. Multi-shell dMRI data were collected at 3.0T using ultra-strong gradients (300 mT/m), using 6 diffusion-weighted shells ranging from b = 0 to 6,000 s/mm2 . Simulations revealed that the correspondence between estimated AFD and simulated intra-axonal signal fraction was improved with high b-value shells due to increased suppression of the extra-axonal signal. These results were supported by in vivo data, as sensitivity to developmental age-relationships was improved with increasing b-value (b = 6,000 s/mm2 , median R2 = .34; b = 4,000 s/mm2 , median R2 = .29; b = 2,400 s/mm2 , median R2 = .21; b = 1,200 s/mm2 , median R2 = .17) in a tract-specific fashion. Overall, estimates of AFD and age-related microstructural development were better characterised at high diffusion-weightings due to improved correspondence with intra-axonal properties.","tags":null,"title":"Impact of b-value on estimates of apparent fibre density","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maxime Chamberland","Sila Genc","Erika P.

It is our opinion that if the field of dMRI tractography wants to be taken seriously as a widespread clinical tool, it is imperative to harmonize WM bundle segmentations and develop protocols aimed to be used in clinical settings. The EADC‐ADNI Harmonized Hippocampal Protocol achieved such standardization through a series of steps that must be reproduced for every WM bundle. This article is an observation of the problematic. A specific bundle segmentation protocol was used in order to provide a real‐life example, but the contribution of this article is to discuss the need for reproducibility and standardized protocol, as for any measurement tool. This study required the participation of 11 experts and 13 nonexperts in neuroanatomy and “virtual dissection ” across various laboratories and hospitals. Intra‐rater agreement (Dice score) was approximately 0.77, while inter‐rater was approximately 0.65. The protocol provided to participants was not necessarily optimal, but its design mimics, in essence, what will be required in future protocols. Reporting tractometry results such as average fractional anisotropy, volume or streamline count of a particular bundle without a sufficient reproducibility score could make the analysis and interpretations more difficult. Coordinated efforts by the diffusion MRI tractography community are needed to quantify and account for reproducibility of WM bundle extraction protocols in this era of open and collaborative science.","tags":null,"title":"Tractostorm: The what, why, and how of tractography dissection reproducibility","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"You can find the presentation here (requires ISMRM login).\n","date":1557705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557705600,"objectID":"b452b8e8503b7b4fc711af3ba3f823d8","permalink":"https://chamberm.github.io/talk/ismrm2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ismrm2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Metrics that Matter - Improved statistical power to detect differences in tissue microstructure through dimensionality reduction.","tags":[],"title":"ISMRM2019","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Maxime Chamberland","Erika P Raven","Sila Genc","Kate Duffy","Maxime Descoteaux","Greg D Parker","Chantal MW Tax","Derek K Jones"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"e4d4f52aec6b38e3216e79452829e19f","permalink":"https://chamberm.github.io/publication/chamberland-2019-dimensionality/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T17:23:47.077426Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chamberland-2019-dimensionality/","section":"publication","summary":"Various diffusion MRI (dMRI) measures have been proposed for characterising tissue microstructure over the last 15 years. Despite the growing number of experiments using different dMRI measures in assessments of white matter, there has been limited work on: 1) examining their covariance along specific pathways; and on 2) combining these different measures to study tissue microstructure. Indeed, it quickly becomes intractable for existing analysis pipelines to process multiple measurements at each voxel and at each vertex forming a streamline, highlighting the need for new ways to visualise or analyse such high-dimensional data. In a sample of 36 typically developing children aged 8-18 years, we profiled various commonly used dMRI measures across 22 brain pathways. Using a data-reduction approach, we identified two biologically-interpretable components that capture 80% of the variance in these dMRI measures. The first derived component captures properties related to hindrance and restriction in tissue microstructure, while the second component reflects characteristics related to tissue complexity and orientational dispersion. We then demonstrate that the components generated by this approach preserve the biological relevance of the original measurements by showing age-related effects across developmentally sensitive pathways. In summary, our findings demonstrate that dMRI analyses can benefit from dimensionality reduction techniques, to help disentangling the neurobiological underpinnings of white matter organisation.","tags":null,"title":"Dimensionality Reduction of Diffusion MRI Measures for Improved Tractometry of the Human Brain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kurt G Schilling","Vishwesh Nath","Colin Hansen","Prasanna Parvathaneni","Justin Blaber","Yurui Gao","Peter Neher","Dogu Baran Aydogan","Yonggang Shi","Mario Ocampo-Pineda"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"84dde907cd8e5356f2beec2190f09f3c","permalink":"https://chamberm.github.io/publication/schilling-2019-limits/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T17:23:47.075424Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schilling-2019-limits/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Limits to anatomical accuracy of diffusion tractography using modern approaches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samuel St-Jean","Maxime Chamberland","Max A Viergever","Alexander Leemans"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"816053c81e864ba09aade388ff88321e","permalink":"https://chamberm.github.io/publication/st-2019-reducing/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T17:23:47.077426Z","relpermalink":"/publication/st-2019-reducing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reducing variability in along-tract analysis with diffusion profile realignment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhengwu Zhang","Maxime Descoteaux","Jingwen Zhang","Gabriel Girard","Maxime Chamberland","David Dunson","Anuj Srivastava","Hongtu Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"0d90479177fe1deb50ec4e5d675e8d23","permalink":"https://chamberm.github.io/publication/zhang-2018-mapping/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T17:23:47.074424Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2018-mapping/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Mapping population-based structural connectomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

The process of virtually reconstructing brain pathways based on these measurements is called tractography. Various metrics can be mapped onto pathways to study their micro-structural properties. Tractometry is an along-tract profiling technique that often requires the extraction of a representative streamline for a given bundle. This is traditionally computed by local averaging of the spatial coordinates of the vertices, and constructing a single streamline through those averages. However, the resulting streamline can end up being highly non-representative of the shape of the individual streamlines forming the bundle. In particular, this occurs when there is variation in the topology of streamlines within a bundle (e.g., differences in length, shape or branching). We propose an envelope-based method to compute a representative streamline that is robust to these individual differences. We demonstrate that this method produces a more representative core streamline, which in turn should lead to more reliable and interpretable tractometry analyses.","tags":null,"title":"Obtaining representative core streamlines for white matter tractometry of the human brain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

However, the source of FC variability inferred from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging remains unclear. One possibility is that these variations are related to individual differences in white matter structural connectivity (SC). However, directly comparing FC with SC is challenging given the many potential biases associated with quantifying their respective strengths. In an attempt to circumvent this, we employed a recently proposed test-retest approach that better quantifies inter-subject variability by first correcting for intra-subject nuisance variability (i.e., head motion, physiological differences in brain state, etc.) that can artificially influence FC and SC measures. Therefore, rather than directly comparing the strength of FC with SC, we asked whether brain regions with, for example, low inter-subject FC variability also exhibited low SC variability. From this, we report two main findings: First, at the whole-brain level, SC variability was significantly lower than FC variability, indicating that an individual's structural connectome is far more similar to another relative to their functional counterpart even after correcting for noise. Second, although FC and SC variability were mutually low in some brain areas (e.g., primary somatosensory cortex) and high in others (e.g., memory and language areas), the two were not significantly correlated across all cortical and sub-cortical regions. Taken together, these results indicate that even after correcting for factors that may differently affect FC and SC, the two, nonetheless, remain largely independent of one another. Further work is needed to understand the role that direct anatomical pathways play in supporting vascular-based measures of FC and to what extent these measures are dictated by anatomical connectivity.","tags":null,"title":"On the Origin of Individual Functional Connectivity Variability: The Role of White Matter Architecture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

However, not all white matter (WM) fascicles are organized in this manner. For example, Meyer's loop is a highly curved portion of the optic radiation (OR) that exhibits a narrow turn, kissing and crossing pathways, and changes in fascicle dispersion. From a neurosurgical perspective, damage to Meyer's loop carries a potential risk of inducing vision deficits to the patient, especially during temporal lobe resection surgery. To prevent such impairment, achieving an accurate delineation of Meyer's loop with tractography is thus of utmost importance. However, current algorithms tend to under-estimate the full extent of Meyer's loop, mainly attributed to the aforementioned rule for connectivity which requires a direction to be chosen across a field of orientations. In this article, it was demonstrated that MAGNEtic Tractography (MAGNET) can benefit Meyer's loop delineation by incorporating anatomical knowledge of the expected fiber orientation to overcome local ambiguities. A new ROI-mechanism was proposed which supplies additional information to streamline reconstruction algorithms by the means of oriented priors. Their results showed that MAGNET can accurately generate Meyer's loop in all of our 15 child subjects (8 males; mean age 10.2 years Â± 3.1). It effectively improved streamline coverage when compared with deterministic tractography, and significantly reduced the distance between the anterior-most portion of Meyer's loop and the temporal pole by 16.7 mm on average, a crucial landmark used for preoperative planning of temporal lobe surgery.

As it stands, the common approach usually consists of analysing fMRI and dMRI datasets separately or using one to inform the other, such as using fMRI activation sites to reconstruct dMRI streamlines that interconnect them. Moreover, given the large inter-individual variability of the healthy human brain, it is possible that valuable information is lost when a fixed set of dMRI/fMRI analysis parameters such as threshold values are assumed constant across subjects. By allowing one to modify such parameters while viewing the results in real-time, one can begin to fully explore the sensitivity of structure-function relations and how they differ across brain areas and individuals. This is especially important when interpreting how structure-function relationships are altered in patients with neurological disorders, such as the presence of a tumor. In this study, we present and validate a novel approach to achieve this: First, we present an interactive method to generate and visualize tractography-driven resting-state functional connectivity, which reduces the bias introduced by seed size, shape and position. Next, we demonstrate that structural and functional reconstruction parameters explain a significant portion of intra- and inter-subject variability. Finally, we demonstrate how our proposed approach can be used in a neurosurgical planning context.

With the advent of diffusion MRI (dMRI) approaches that can also model \"crossing fibers\", the complexity of the fiber network as reconstructed with tractography has increased tremendously. Many pathways interdigitate and overlap, which hampers an unequivocal 3D visualization of the network and impedes an efficient study of its organization. We propose a novel fiber tractography visualization approach that interactively and selectively adapts the transparency rendering of fiber trajectories as a function of their orientation to enhance the visibility of the spatial context. More specifically, pathways that are oriented (locally or globally) along a user-specified opacity axis can be made more transparent or opaque. This substantially improves the 3D visualization of the fiber network and the exploration of tissue configurations that would otherwise be largely covered by other pathways. We present examples of fiber bundle extraction and neurosurgical planning cases where the added benefit of our new visualization scheme is demonstrated over conventional fiber visualization approaches.","tags":null,"title":"Seeing More by Showing Less: Orientation-Dependent Transparency Rendering for Fiber Tractography Visualization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O Vaillancourt","M Chamberland","Houde, J-C ","M Descoteaux"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"146eecb01da741f0c8e933d141a774aa","permalink":"https://chamberm.github.io/publication/vaillancourt-2015-visualization/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T17:23:47.067418Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vaillancourt-2015-visualization/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Visualization of Diffusion Propagator and Multiple Parameter Diffusion Signal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Tractography is nowadays central in structural connectivity since it is the only non-invasive technique to obtain information about brain wiring. Most publicly available tractography techniques and most studies are based on a fixed set of tractography parameters. However, the scale and curvature of fiber bundles can vary from region to region in the brain. Therefore, depending on the area of interest or subject (e.g., healthy control vs. tumor patient), optimal tracking parameters can be dramatically different. As a result, a slight change in tracking parameters may return different connectivity profiles and complicate the interpretation of the results. Having access to tractography parameters can thus be advantageous, as it will help in better isolating those which are sensitive to certain streamline features and potentially converge on optimal settings which are area-specific. In this work, we propose a real-time fiber tracking (RTT) tool which can instantaneously compute and display streamlines. To achieve such real-time performance, we propose a novel evolution equation based on the upsampled principal directions, also called peaks, extracted at each voxel of the dMRI dataset. The technique runs on a single Computer Processing Unit (CPU) without the need for Graphical Unit Processing (GPU) programming. We qualitatively illustrate and quantitatively evaluate our novel multi-peak RTT technique on phantom and human datasets in comparison with the state of the art offline tractography from MRtrix, which is robust to fiber crossings. Finally, we show how our RTT tool facilitates neurosurgical planning and allows one to find fibers that infiltrate tumor areas, otherwise missing when using the standard default tracking parameters.","tags":null,"title":"Real-time multi-peak tractography for instantaneous connectivity display","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michaël Bernier","Maxime Chamberland","Jean-Christophe Houde","Maxime Descoteaux","Kevin Whittingstall"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"f86e5c6a03ca2d9944c2ea717d2f9e6c","permalink":"https://chamberm.github.io/publication/bernier-2014-using/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T17:23:47.066417Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bernier-2014-using/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Using fMRI non-local means denoising to uncover activation in sub-cortical structures at 1.5 T for guided HARDI tractography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

Based on a nonlocal patch-based strategy, the proposed method uses a non-diffusion image (b0) to constrain the reconstruction of DW images. An extensive validation is presented with a gold standard built on averaging 10 high-resolution DW acquisitions. A comparison with classical interpolation methods such as trilinear and B-spline demonstrates the competitive results of our proposed approach in terms of improvements on image reconstruction, fractional anisotropy (FA) estimation, generalized FA and angular reconstruction for tensor and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) models. Besides, first results of reconstructed ultra high resolution DW images are presented at 0.6Ã—0.6Ã—0.6 mm3 and 0.4Ã—0.4Ã—0.4 mm3 using our gold standard based on the average of 10 acquisitions, and on a single acquisition. Finally, fiber tracking results show the potential of the proposed super-resolution approach to accurately analyze white matter brain architecture.","tags":null,"title":"Collaborative patch-based super-resolution for diffusion-weighted images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maxime Chamberland"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"d0ccd0d726e44d80ba3cdb3cb06d72f5","permalink":"https://chamberm.github.io/publication/chamberland-2013-visualisation/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T17:23:47.065416Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chamberland-2013-visualisation/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Visualisation en imagerie par résonance magnétique de diffusion : Tractographie en temps réel des fibres de la matière blanche du cerveau","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G Girard","M Chamberland","JC Houde","D Fortin","M Descoteaux"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"26991f80c241029273d125a57ad0bbc8","permalink":"https://chamberm.github.io/publication/girard-2012-neurosurgical/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T17:23:47.076425Z","relpermalink":"/publication/girard-2012-neurosurgical/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Neurosurgical tracking at the sherbrooke connectivity imaging lab (SCIL)","type":"publication"}]

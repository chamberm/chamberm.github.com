 abstract = {In multiple sclerosis studies, lesion volume (or lesion load) derived from conventional T2 imaging correlates modestly with clinical assessment. Determining which specific white matter pathways are impacted by lesions may provide additional insights regarding task-specific clinical impairment. Using diffusion MRI, we introduce a set of tract-based metrics that go beyond traditional lesion load approaches and show how they relate to task performance (i.e., working memory, information processing and verbal fluency) in a cohort of 40 patients with multiple sclerosis.},

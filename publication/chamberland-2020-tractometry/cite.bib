 abstract = {There is an urgent need for a paradigm shift from group-wise comparisons to individual diagnosis in diffusion MRI (dMRI) to enable the analysis of rare cases and clinicallyheterogeneous groups. Deep autoencoders have shown great potential to detect anomalies
in neuroimaging data. We present a framework that operates on the manifold of white matter (WM) pathways to learn normative microstructural features, and discriminate those at
genetic risk from controls in a paediatric population.},
